# Regex Reveal

Welcome to the Regex Reveal tutorial, where we unravel the mysteries of regular expressions (regex) in JavaScript. This guide will explore a specific regex and break down each component, providing a detailed understanding of its functionality. Whether you're a web development student or a curious coder, this tutorial aims to demystify the intricacies of regex and enhance your comprehension of search patterns in JavaScript.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will dissect the regex for "Matching a Hex Value": /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/. This regex validates whether a given string represents a hexadecimal color code, allowing for variations with or without a leading '#' symbol. The tutorial will delve into different regex components, explaining their roles and providing code snippets for better comprehension.
